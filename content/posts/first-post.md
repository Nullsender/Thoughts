# My greeting
For the zero people reading this I bid you welcome. This is my humble attempt at making a small blog.

I have now used my entire evening setting up a workflow such that I can easily write a blogpost. I am currently using Hugo and I am writing this text with GNU nano 8.2.

My intentions for doing this is that I sometimes get interrested in things, think about them, read about them, and sudenly no more. The thoughts stop and when I think back it feels
like something important has been erased. It is kind of strange, we get all these thoughts and the next moment they are gone. A lot of the thoughts I have had where unproductive and 
not worth reproducing or remembering. Maybe only the thoughts and actions worth remembering are remembered. Anyways I have for a long time wanted to create a space where I can write
some of these thoughts down and here we are. Another thing is that I want to become a better writer and thinker and I do belive writing a lot will help me in this pursuit. 

The idea of documenting a life experience is very cool to me. Capturing the development and outlook on life througout life. 

I will now test how equations are displayed on the blog:

$$
\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f^2(x)dx=\frac{1}{2}a_0^2+\sum_{n=1}^{\inf}\left(a_n^2+b_n^2\right).
$$

\begin{align*}
1+2=5\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}

$$33+333_2$$
